# Heart Disease Prediction Project Summary

In this machine learning project, we aim to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset consists of various features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more. Three machine learning algorithms, namely K Neighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier, are employed for predictive modeling.

# Key Steps:

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explored the dataset to understand its structure and relationships between variables. Feature selection was performed based on correlations to identify key features influencing heart disease.

## Data Processing: 
Categorical variables were converted into dummy variables, and the dataset was standardized using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity in model training. Dummy columns were created for categorical features, and numerical features were scaled.

## Modeling - K Neighbors Classifier:
Implemented K Neighbors Classifier with varying numbers of neighbors (K) and evaluated performance using cross-validation.
Selected the optimal K value based on cross-validation scores.

## Model Evaluation - K Neighbors Classifier:

Evaluated the K Neighbors Classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Checked confusion matrix for a more detailed understanding of model performance.

## Modeling - Random Forest Classifier:

Utilized Random Forest Classifier for heart disease prediction.
Conducted cross-validation to assess the model's performance.

## Model Evaluation - Random Forest Classifier:

Evaluated the Random Forest Classifier using relevant metrics.
Explored feature importances to identify key factors influencing predictions.

# Next Steps:

Explored hyperparameter tuning for both models.
Ensured proper use of cross-validation for all models.
Considered ensemble methods for potential performance improvement.

# Results:

The K Neighbors Classifier achieved a mean cross-validation score of approximately 84.5%.
The Random Forest Classifier achieved a mean cross-validation score of around 80.2%.
This project provides insights into the predictive capabilities of different machine learning algorithms for heart disease detection, laying the foundation for further refinement and improvement.

# Here are some Improvement on which I am working.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:
Explore hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal parameters for your models. This can be done using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
## Cross-Validation:
Make sure to use cross-validation properly. In your current implementation, you've used cross-validation for the K Neighbors Classifier, but you may want to perform cross-validation for Random Forest as well.
## Feature Importance:
For Random Forest, you can check feature importance to understand which features contribute more to the predictions.
## Ensemble Methods:
Consider trying ensemble methods like Bagging or Boosting to potentially improve model performance.
## Model Comparison:
Compare the performance of different models and choose the one that performs best on your specific dataset.
